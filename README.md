# Demographic Clinical Report

This project demonstrates how to create a publication-ready demographic clinical report using R. It summarizes clinical trial data by treatment group (placebo, XYZ 5mg, XYZ 10mg, XYZ 50mg) and generates an RTF report suitable for clinical documentation.

## Project Overview

- Summarized subject demographics across treatment arms using frequency counts and percentages.
- Used `tidyverse` for data manipulation and `r2rtf` for RTF table generation.
- Output includes a formatted RTF report (`tbl_13_1_2.rtf`) ready for inclusion in clinical study reports.

## Files Included

- `Clinical report data1.csv`: Sample clinical trial data.
- `demographic_report.R`: R script to generate the demographic report.
- `tbl_13_1_2.rtf`: Output RTF file containing the formatted demographic table.

## Technologies Used

- R
- tidyverse
- r2rtf

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `demographic_report.R` in RStudio.
3. Ensure the working directory is set correctly.
4. Run the script to generate the `tbl_13_1_2.rtf` output.
